# FacialRecognitionSystem
The idea is to reduce the number of thefts that occur in our houses and work places by implementing a homemade security system that is easy to install and implement. The system consists of a laser that is pointed onto a receiver. The receiver keeps sending “High voltage” to the Raspberry Pi. If the laser is broken, then the Input to the Pi cuts off, this triggers an alarm. It sends an E-Mail or a message to the owner on the registered email address that his security is being breached. It then enables the image scanner which scans the image of the person standing at the gate and if the person’s face is stored in the dataset, it allows access into the gate and the security is disabled. Confront acknowledgment is one of those testing issues and up and coming, there is no method that gives a strong answer for all circumstances. This paper introduces another procedure for human face acknowledgment. This strategy utilizes a picture based approach towards manmade brainpower by expelling repetitive information from face pictures through picture pressure utilizing the two-dimensional discrete cosine change (2D-DCT)
